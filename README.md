# GPT-4 & LangChain - Create a ChatGPT Chatbot for college students

## Development

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone [github https url]
```

2. Install packages

```
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your `.env` file

- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
  Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=

PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=

```

- Visit [openai](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to retrieve API keys and insert into your `.env` file.
- Visit [pinecone](https://pinecone.io/) to create and retrieve your API keys.

4. In `config/pinecone.ts`, replace the `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` with the index name you
   created on Pinecone. Edit the `TOPICS` to match your desired topics, namespaces,
   and prompts. There should be a matching folder in `docs` for each of your topics. **THE FOLDER MUST EXACTLY MATCH THE TOPIC'S NAMESPACE AND MUST ONLY CONTAIN LOWER CASE LETTERS A-Z AND HYPHENS.**

5. In `utils/makechain.ts` chain adjust the `QA_PROMPT` according to your use case. Change `modelName` in `new OpenAIChat` to a different api model if you don't have access to `gpt-4`. See [the OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) for a list of supported `modelName`s. For example you could use `gpt-3.5-turbo` if you do not have access to `gpt-4`, yet.

## Convert your PDF to embeddings

1. In `docs` add PDFs into the relevant folder for each topic. ChatGPT will show which PDF it referred to in the sources so give your PDFs descriptive names.

2. Run the script `pnpm run ingest` to 'ingest' and embed your docs

3. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify your namespace and vectors have been added.

## Run the app

Once you've verified that the embeddings and content have been successfully added to your Pinecone, you can run the app `pnpm run dev` to launch the local dev environment and then type a question in the chat interface.

## Troubleshooting

In general, keep an eye out in the `issues` and `discussions` section of this repo for solutions.

**General errors**

- Make sure you're running the latest Node version. Run `node -v`
- Make sure you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repo.
- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys.
- If you change `modelName` in `OpenAIChat` note that the correct name of the alternative model is `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Pinecone indexes of users on the Starter(free) plan are deleted after 7 days of inactivity. To prevent this, send an API request to Pinecone to reset the counter.

**Pinecone errors**

- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in your `config` folder.
- Check that you've set the vector dimensions to `1536`.
- Switch your Environment in pinecone to `us-east1-gcp` if the other environment is causing issues.

**Deleting a namespace**

- If you need to clear a namespace and to re-ingest it again you can edit the target namespace and the
  target index in `scripts/delete-namespace.ts` and then perform `pnpm run delete-namespace`

If you're stuck after trying all these steps, delete `node_modules`, restart your computer, then `pnpm install` again.
